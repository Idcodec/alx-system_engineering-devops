Issue Summary:
Duration: March 1st, 2023, 1:30 AM - March 1st, 2023, 2:15 AM (PST)
Impact: High impact, around 70% of the users were affected. Users experienced slow load times and timeouts when attempting to access the website.
Root Cause: An unexpected surge in traffic due to a promotional campaign caused the system to overload, leading to slow load times and timeouts.

Timeline:

1:30 AM - The issue was detected as users reported slow load times and timeouts.
1:32 AM - The incident escalated to the engineering team.
1:35 AM - The team started investigating the system and found that the web servers were overloaded with traffic.
1:40 AM - The team attempted to optimise the web servers by increasing their capacity, but this did not solve the issue.
1:50 AM - The team realised that the unexpected surge in traffic was due to a promotional campaign that was not properly anticipated.
2:00 AM - The team quickly implemented a caching system and load balancing to help reduce the load on the servers.
2:15 AM - The issue was resolved as users were able to access the website without any issues.
Root Cause and Resolution:
The root cause of the issue was an unexpected surge in traffic due to a promotional campaign. The system was not designed to handle such a large influx of traffic, leading to slow load times and timeouts. The team resolved the issue by implementing a caching system and load balancing to help reduce the load on the servers. This helped to distribute the load across multiple servers, ensuring that the website was able to handle the increased traffic.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:
To prevent similar issues in the future, the team will need to take several corrective and preventative measures, including:

Implementing an auto-scaling system to automatically adjust the capacity of the servers based on traffic.
Increasing monitoring and alerting to better detect unexpected surges in traffic.
Conducting regular load testing to ensure that the system can handle anticipated traffic.
Reviewing promotional campaigns in advance to anticipate potential surges in traffic.
Tasks to address the issue:

Implement auto-scaling on the web servers.
Increase monitoring and alerting to detect unexpected surges in traffic.
Conduct regular load testing to ensure that the system can handle anticipated traffic.
Review promotional campaigns in advance to anticipate potential surges in traffic.
Conduct a postmortem review to identify areas for improvement and adjust processes accordingly.
In conclusion, the unexpected surge in traffic caused the system to overload, leading to slow load times and timeouts. The team was able to quickly implement a caching system and load balancing to help reduce the load on the servers and resolve the issue. Moving forward, the team will take corrective and preventative measures to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future.
